# Hello World!

DScape stands for Digital Scape - a digital representation of what's happening around us.

DScape is the realization of a personal dream: a digital repository of my projects, interests, and thoughts. Most of my work falls within the geospatial domain and includes:

* Utilizing satellite data
* Explaining new satellite missions
* Storytelling with satellite data, focusing on current events
* Showcasing new geospatial methods and tutorials

You might find some of this interesting, or maybe not. Either way, feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section under each post. I'll also try to answer any technical or methodological questions you might have.

The (initial) plan is to publish something new every month.
