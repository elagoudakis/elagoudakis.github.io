# Hello World!
This is my first post!

Dscape = Digital Scape. A digital representation of what is happening around us.

DScape is the fruition of a personal dream. A digital repository of my projects, interests, thoughts.
My projects typically belong to the geospatial domain:
* Use of satellite data
* Explaining new satellite missions
* Storytelling with satellite data with an emphasis on what is happening around us
* Showcasing new geospatial methods/ tutorials


Maybe you will find some of it interesting, maybe not. You can always let me know by using the comments under every post. I will also try to answer to technical/ methodolody questions.

 I plan to upload one post every month, typically the first week.
