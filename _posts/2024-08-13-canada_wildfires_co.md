### The (historic?) 2024 fire season

ðŸ”¥ The 2024 fire season in the Northern Hemisphere is under way and may be as destructive as, or even more than, the 2023 season. 
The animation below, utilizes data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P (S5P) satellite, and illustrates the average carbon monoxide (CO) concentration around the Arctic Circle for July from 2021 to 2024. 
The primary sources of emissions are located in the boreal forests of Canadaâ€”Alberta, northeastern British Columbia, southern Northwest Territoriesâ€”and Russia, particularly Yakutia.

ðŸ“– CO is an important atmospheric trace gas for understanding tropospheric chemistry. Main sources of CO are combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning, and atmospheric oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons. 
TROPOMI on the S5P satellite observes the CO global abundance exploiting clear-sky and cloudy-sky Earth radiance measurements in the 2.3 Î¼m spectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the solar spectrum.
