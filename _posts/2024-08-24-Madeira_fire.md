## August 2024 Madeira forest fire 

üî• A large forest fire broke out in Madeira, Portugal, on 14 August 2024.
The image pair shows how the devastating fire spread from the center of the island near Serra de √Ågua on 17 August, moving towards the southwest and northeast by 20 August.

Fire pixels from the VIIRS instrument (Suomi-NPP satellite) have been overlaid to help identify the active fire fronts.

**Important**: The overlaid fire pixels represent data from the entire days, while the images are acquired in the mornings.
