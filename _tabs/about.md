Hi! Thank you for visiting my page.

My name is Manos. I am a remote sensing specialist with +12 years of professional experience in the geospatial domain.

I am currently working for the European Space Agency (ESA), producing high-quality data visualisations to the broadest audience possible through the outreach channels of the European Space Agency (ESA).

MSc in Environmental monitoring, modelling and management from the University of London, Kingâ€™s College and BA degree in Physical Geography from the University of the Aegean, Greece. I am very keen in science communication, storytelling, mapping and innovative technologies.

In this page expect to find (visual) samples of my work, interesting shares and information relevant to the geospatial ecosystem.
