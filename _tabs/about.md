## What 

__DScape__ stands for __Digital Scape__ - a digital representation of what's happening around us.

DScape is the realization of a personal project.

In this digital repo, expect to find a variety of content, including __visual samples of my work__, __quick tutorials__, __interesting shares__, and information relevant to the geospatial ecosystem. Additionally, I occasionally post __personal thoughts__ on general topics.

You might find some of the topics interesting, or maybe not. Either way, feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section under each post. I'll also try to answer any technical or methodological questions you might have.

The (initial) plan is to publish something new every month.

## Who

My name is Manos, and I am a remote sensing specialist with over 12 years of professional experience in the geospatial domain.

For the majority of my career, I have worked with the __European Space Agency (ESA)__, delivering high-quality data visualizations to a wide audience through the Agencyâ€™s outreach channels.
